    "* Variable is a name assigned to any Python object \n",
    "* Can assign a variable to any Python object\n",
    "* Used as a refernce point for values that may not be known at the start of a program\n",
    "* Should be named descriptively, using underscores to separate multiple words\n",
    "* Avoid [reserved words](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_keywords.asp) \n",
    "* Avoid conventions like num1, num2\n",
    "### input()\n",
    "* input is a top level built-in function\n",
    "* Can be used to get and store values from a user\n",
    "* Can be used to introduce a pause in code execution\n",
    "* Can be thought of as a listener waiting for the enter key to be pressed\n",
    "* Data captured by input will be string data\n",
    "### Recasting\n",
    "* Transforming one object type to another\n",
    "* Commonly used transformations:\n",
    "    * int([value])\n",
    "    * float([value])\n",
    "    * str([value])\n",
    "    \n",

    "* = --> assignment operator\n",

    "* += --> incrementer \n",
